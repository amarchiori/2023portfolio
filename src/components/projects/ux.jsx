                A prototype design for an activity app. The Italian word Attivit√† in english is Activity. A fun playful app search for nearby activities to do in your spare time.

                <span>Challenges</span>
                User experience was my top priority for this project. By understanding the user, understanding why this use would be on my app, I could create a smooth roadmap for them. THe biggest challenge was not to overcomplicated and overwhelm the screen with too many colors, actions, and information for the user.

                <span>Approach</span>
                Below are screeshots from my original case study, outlining my exact process. Field Research included asking the right questions to then create a specific user/persona to "test" my app. Design Process included many sketches and eventually wireframing to outline a road map for the various paths a user could follow. My favorite part of the process for any project is the moodboard of colors, fonts, and logo.
